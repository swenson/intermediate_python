:mod:`ctypes`
=============

:mod:`ctypes` is a module that is primarily geared toward interfacing with dynamic libraries, especially those
with public C APIs.  It does this by supporting dynamic library loading at run-time and mapping library function
calls to Python calls (and vice versa), interfacing by mapping Python types to C types (and vice versa).
Hence the name, :mod:`ctypes`.
