Preface
=======

This is an intermediate course in Python programming, going beyond the basics of the language
and its syntax and introducing powerful concepts to simplify and empower your code while
maintaining clarity and readability.

When possible, we will comment on the generic Python language, although there are some
details that vary across different implementations, such as CPython, Jython, IronPython,
PyPy, and others.  When we do delve into specifics, we will address CPython first and
foremost, since it is the baseline implementation and the most popular.
